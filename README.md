Continuing on from the prior unit, this project contains the resulting output of the instructor's AI when prompted for prioritization simplification (highest compensation only) in `people_headcount_app.py`. The learner can optionally start from here to prompt for the impact score feature.

To run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run people_headcount_app.py
```
